## About Trial
Trial is a game engine written in Common Lisp. Unlike many other engines, it is meant to be more of a loose connection of components that can be fit together as required by any particular game.

The project is still in its very early stages and may change heavily as new constraints become clear. As such there is no guarantee for API stability at this point and no documentation is available.
