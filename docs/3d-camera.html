However, it is very likely that you'll want to heavily customise them to your particular use-case, as optimal camera movement in games is a very difficult and situation-specific topic.</p><p>At the basis is the <code>3d-camera</code>, which sets up a perspective projection, based on the <code>fov</code> parameter. The fov is designated in degrees, and should be between 0 and 180. Each of the cameras also implements a <code>focal-point</code>, which is used for certain rendering optimisations and can be used for special effects as well.</p><p>The <code>target-camera</code> simply ensures that the camera is always looking at the <code>target</code> position. The target should be some kind of object with a <code>location</code> that resolves to a world-space position.</p><p>The <code>following-camera</code> instead uses the camera's <code>location</code> as a fixed offset from the <code>target</code>.</p><p>The <code>fps-camera</code> implements basic first-person look using mouse input. Using the <code>x-acceleration</code> and <code>y-acceleration</code> properties you can control the speed of the turning and invert it for each axis separately as well.</p><p>The <code>freeroam-camera</code> additionally implements moving and strafing on top of the <code>fps-camera</code>. However, since neither the freeroam nor the basic fps camera use the <a class="external-link" href="input.html">action system</a>, it is recommended that you instead replicate their logic in your own system.</p><p>Finally the <code>editor-camera</code> is the same as the <code>freeroam-camera</code> but locking the looking behind the middle mouse or control buttons, to ensure the mouse can be normally moved without moving the view.</p></article></body></html>
