}</style><h1 id="releasing games">Releasing Games</h1><p>While you can simply use <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/shinmera/deploy">Deploy</a> or some other system to create a bundle of your game, it is often useful to automate the build for multiple operating systems and also automate the submission. For this purpose, the <code>trial-release</code> extension exists This is a system offering automation for pushing releases of your game to a zip, Steam, Itch.io, or other services.</p><h2 id="getting set up">Getting Set Up</h2><p>First you'll want to create a new ASDF system for your game's release. The ASD file should be in a directory where your releases will be put, so ideally not in the game's source root. The ASD should be something like this:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>(asdf:defsystem my-game-release
  :components ((:file &quot;release&quot;))
  :depends-on (:trial-release)
  :perform (asdf:build-op (op c) (uiop:symbol-call :org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release :make)))</pre></code><p>The <code>release</code> file can just be:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>(org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release:configure
 :itch (:user &quot;my-itch-username&quot;)
 :steam (:user &quot;my-steam-username&quot;)
 :system &quot;my-game&quot;)</pre></code><p>There are other configuration parameters you can set if necessary to customise the build and release process.</p><p>Finally, you'll also want to configure your game's ASD system to include the following options:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>  :build-operation &quot;deploy-op&quot;
  :build-pathname #+linux &quot;my-game-linux.run&quot;
                  #+darwin &quot;my-game-macos.o&quot;
                  #+win32 &quot;my-game-windows&quot;
                  #+(and bsd (not darwin)) &quot;my-game-bsd.run&quot;
                  #-(or linux bsd win32) &quot;my-game&quot;
  :entry-point &quot;my-game::main&quot;
  :defsystem-depends-on (:deploy)</pre></code><p>You can adapt the build pathnames as you wish, as long as the pathname types stay consistent: <code>.run</code> for Linux, <code>.o</code> for MacOS, and none for Windows (<code>.exe</code> is added by default). You can also adapt the entry point as you choose.</p><p>Outside of this, you'll have to have the following binaries set up in your PATH:</p><ul><li><p><code>butler</code><br>The itch.io release tool. You'll need this if you want to release to itch.</p></li><li><p><code>steamcmd.sh</code><br>The steam command tool. You'll need this if you want to release to Steam.</p></li><li><p><code>sbcl-lin</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL binary used to build the Linux version. This should be a binary that was compiled on the minimum linux kernel version you want to support. It's also recommended that you modify the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> of it to include a directory with all necessary libraries also compiled on the same minimum kernel version.</p></li><li><p><code>sbcl-win</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL Windows binary used to build the Windows version. This can be a wrapper using Wine, which works really well to build for Windows under Linux.</p></li><li><p><code>sbcl-mac</code> (linux)<br>The SBCL binary used to build the Mac version. This is currently unsupported, but in the future once Darling works better this could be used to deploy to that platform from Linux as well.</p></li><li><p><code>pass</code> (optional)<br>Used to retrieve the Steam account password automatically. If not present, will query for a password at the REPL.</p></li></ul><p>Once all of this is ready, you can run a build using <code>(asdf:make :my-game-release)</code> or manually invoking <code>org.shirakumo.fraf.trial.release:make</code> after loading that system.<br>For the <code>sbcl-*</code> variants, you can use the binaries and scripts from the following repository: <a href="https://gitea.tymoon.eu/shinmera/trial-deployment">https://gitea.tymoon.eu/shinmera/trial-deployment</a> They have been pre-tested.</p><h2 id="setting up steam">Setting up Steam</h2><p>Steam will require some VDF files to configure your build in addition. Please consult the SteamWorks documentation on how to do that. However, be aware that the base file should be called <code>app-build.vdf</code> and should be in the same directory as your <code>my-game-release.asd</code> file, and should have several fields set specially so the Trial release mechanism can operate properly. Here's an example:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>&quot;appbuild&quot;{
  &quot;appid&quot; &quot;1261430&quot;
  &quot;desc&quot; &quot;Kandria developer build&quot;
  &quot;buildoutput&quot; &quot;../steam/&quot;
  &quot;contentroot&quot; &quot;$CONTENT&quot;
  &quot;setlive&quot; &quot;$BRANCH&quot;
  &quot;preview&quot; &quot;$PREVIEW&quot;
  &quot;local&quot; &quot;&quot;
  &quot;depots&quot;{
    &quot;1261431&quot; &quot;../windows-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261432&quot; &quot;../linux-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261433&quot; &quot;../macos-depot.vdf&quot;
    &quot;1261434&quot; &quot;../content-depot.vdf&quot;
  }
}</pre></code><p>The Trial release build will automatically take this file and replace the <code>$</code> variables, then copy it to a subdirectory where the upload happens, hence the <code>../</code> backrefs in the paths. The depot VDF files do not need any special configuration.</p><h2 id="config options">Config Options</h2><p>The configuration you can set is a tree of options, here shown with default values:</p><code style="display:block" class="code-block"><pre>(:build (:features ()                    ; A list of symbols to push onto *features* when building
         :build-arguments ()             ; A list of command line argmuents to pass on when building

                                         ; Paths are relative to the target directory.
