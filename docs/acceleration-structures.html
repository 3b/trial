Adding a broad phase collision detection structure to reduce the number of tests is a good first step towards dealing with this problem.</p><p>Trial does not ship any spatial query structures itself, but it does already rely on the <a class="external-link" href="https://shirakumo.org/projects/3d-spaces">3d-spaces</a> library, which offers several different structures that you can choose from to best suit your purpose. Please consult its documentation for more hints on usage.</p><p>Some subsystems in the engine also make use of a query structure. Especially the physics subsystem requires one on the <code>physics-system</code> to provide any sort of acceptable performance. The <code>light-cache-render-pass</code> also makes use of a structure to quickly cull lights.</p><p>Trial provides handy bridging methods to allow the standard <code>enter</code>, <code>leave</code>, <code>clear</code>, <code>location</code>, and <code>bsize</code> from Trial to be used analogously to the same-named functions provided by 3d-spaces.</p></article></body></html>
