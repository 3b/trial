# Physically Based Rendering Model
Trial provides a "standard renderer"(link standard-renderer.mess) that implements a Physically Based Rendering shading model and associated material. To use it, simply enter a ``pbr-render-pass`` and ensure your objects provide a ``pbr-material``, or some appropriate conversion exists.

The model uses a Cook-Torrance BRDF to implement the shading behaviour, and it is recommended to use it in combination with an HDR pipeline.

## Material Properties
Each material has the following properties:

- Albedo
  This is put together through the ``albedo-texture`` and the ``albedo-factor``, both of which are 4-component. The alpha component allows you to make semi-transparent materials.
- Metalness, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion
  This is put together through the ``metal-rough-occlusion-texture`` and the ``metalness-factor``, ``roughness-factor`` and ``occlusion-factor``. You may also specify the textures individually through the ``metal-rough-texture`` or ``metalness-texture``, ``roughness-texture``, and ``occlusion-texture``. If you specify them individually, they will be merged manually before upload, which may be expensive.
- Emission
  The ``emission-texture`` and ``emission-factor`` allow you to create materials that appear to emit light. In practise this will just cause the material to be very bright, causing bloom to take hold. This only works in combination with an HDR pipeline.  
- Normal
  The ``normal-texture`` provides the standard normal mapping behaviour.
- Alpha-Cutoff
  The ``alpha-cutoff`` designates a threshold below which the material is considered fully transparent.

## Image Based Lighting
The PBR renderer supports an image based lighting workflow. For this purpose it provides a special light type, the ``environment-light``. The light requires an "``environment-map``"(link environment-maps.mess) instance as the ``:asset`` initarg, which it uses to get the needed irradiance and prefiltered environment maps.

When the light is active in the scene it will provide ambient lighting for all objects based on the environment map. You can optionally control for its strength via the light's ``color``, which simply acts as a multiplier.
