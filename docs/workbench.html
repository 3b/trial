Many a feature or effect have been created using it, and it can be a good debugging aid to give a very minimal base case to test stuff against.</p><p>Do note that the workbench also uses the <a class="external-link" href="https://shirakumo.org/projects/trial-assets">trial-assets</a> repository to provide sample data. You can make use of those samples in your own projects as well.</p></article></body></html>
