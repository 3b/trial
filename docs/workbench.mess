# Workbench
Trial includes a system called ``trial-workbench`` which loads a bunch of commonly used dependencies, and then a file called ``workbench.lisp``. The file usually contains a setup that shows off some of Trial's capabilities, or in the case of a PR, a specific demo related to the feature being implemented.

The workbench is meant as a simple playground you can use to try things out with Trial. Many a feature or effect have been created using it, and it can be a good debugging aid to give a very minimal base case to test stuff against.

Do note that the workbench also uses the "trial-assets"(https://shirakumo.org/projects/trial-assets) repository to provide sample data. You can make use of those samples in your own projects as well.
